# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Sean Mitani and I am a student at
[Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is mathematics
with a concentration in probability and statistics. I plan on graduating in
2027 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

      To start with, my first favorite assignment included the second lab since
    it was both enjoyable and entertaining to learn how I could make a program
    that would imitate a round of Mad Libs. By using statements for both
    "std::cin" and "std::cout," I could combine them with "std::strings" to
    create a game that requests a certain word as its input from the user for
    each blank line. After all the variables had a value attached to them, it
    would display the entire story as its output by replacing spaces that were
    previously empty with words which had been stored. Therefore, it was fun to
    see how I could make my own Mad Lib by not only inventing alternate
    sentences but also declaring different variables such as adjectives or past
    tense verbs. Most importantly, this game is not limited to only one
    participant and can also be completed with multiple players at once by
    letting them take turns with the device.

* Lab 3

      Furthermore, my next favorite assignment involved the third lab because I
    was impressed to see how the program from its first part could quickly
    calculate an individual's basal metabolic rate based on only three
    measurements. Apart from using "std::cin" along with "std::cout" to display
    the total calories, it built upon the previous lab and demonstrated how
    doubles could be used to hold amounts with decimals. Above all, it
    introduced me to the idea of binary operators by providing examples as to
    how asterisks denote multiplication, plus signs indicate addition, and
    minus signs signify subtraction. Moreover, I realized how practical this
    type of program could be for those who have health issues by allowing them
    to save energy or time if they must consistently compute various vital
    signs on their own. Likewise, the second part was equally as insightful
    through the application of function definitions that would identify the
    number of days between two distinct dates according to a Gregorian
    calendar.

* Lab 7

      Finally, my third favorite assignment was the seventh lab as it would
    instantly inform the user if the date and time that they entered
    successfully met specific conditions through countless parking rules. Even
    though this lab featured "if statements" for each condition, it mainly
    allowed me to become familiar with the concept of command line arguments as
    well as "true" or "false" values from Boolean variables. Additionally, it
    provided me with the opportunity to practice incorporating logical
    operators in my code with two ampersands to constitute "and," two pipe
    symbols to represent "or," and one exclamation point to symbolize negation
    or "not." In short, it was helpful to discover and understand how a program
    could change its executed output by validating whether a user's input met
    the conditions that were listed or not. Besides being adjusted with a
    separate set of rules, this code could be modified to redirect the user to
    another prompt if their input fails the first condition as opposed to
    simply terminating the whole program.
